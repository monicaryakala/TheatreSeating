Theatre Seating:
=======================================================================================================================================
1) In this Coding Challenge, my first priority was to put the parties as close to the front as possible.

2) If there are not enough seats available in the theatre to handle a party, displays a message saying "sorry! we can't handle your party".

3) Each party must sit in a single row in a single section. If they won't fit, message says "Call to Split party"

========================================================================================================================================
Input:
========================================================================================================================================

2. Enter the total number of reservations.
